## Features

The user management web app follows the following flow:

1. **User List**: The initial screen displays a list of users, showcasing their names, email addresses, and other relevant details. Users can view, edit, or delete existing user records.

2. **Create User**: Users have the ability to create new user records by providing necessary information such as name, email address, and additional details. The app validates the input and adds the new user to the user list.

3. **Edit User**: Users can update existing user records by accessing an edit page. The edit page pre-populates the form fields with the current user data, allowing users to modify and save the changes.

4. **View User**: Clicking on a user's details from the user list provides a detailed view of the user's information. This view-only mode allows users to review the user's data without the ability to make changes.

5. **Delete User**: Users can delete user records through an individual delete option on each user's details page.
